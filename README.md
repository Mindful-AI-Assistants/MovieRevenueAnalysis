#  <p align="center"> 🎬💰  Movie Companies Revenue Analysis: Statistical Insights and Release Strategies

Analyze movie companies' revenue, release strategies, and financial performance using statistical techniques for actionable insights. This project explores data on total revenue, number of releases, and lifetime gross to uncover patterns that can drive strategic decisions in the film industry.

## 📄 Project Description
This project focuses on a financial and strategic analysis of movie companies, examining key variables such as **total revenue**, **number of releases**, and **lifetime gross** over time. We employ descriptive and inferential statistical techniques to uncover valuable insights that can support strategic decision-making in the film industry.

## 🔍 Analysis Objectives
- **Explore and understand the data** to identify patterns and trends in the film industry.
- **Apply statistical techniques** to test hypotheses about the financial performance of companies.
- **Visualize the relationships among key variables** such as release count and revenue to gain insights.

## 📈 Techniques Used
The analysis uses several statistical methods and visualizations, including:
- **Descriptive Analysis**: Basic statistics (mean, median, mode, variance).
- **T-Tests**: Comparison of variable means with specific reference values.
- **Correlation Heatmap**: Visualization of numeric variable relationships to identify correlations.
