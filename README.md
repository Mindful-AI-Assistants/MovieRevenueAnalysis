This analysis investigates the financial performance of movie brands and studios, focusing on key revenue metrics: **Total Revenue**, **Releases**, and **Lifetime Gross**. Using descriptive statistics, t-tests, correlation analysis, and graphical representations, we explore the relationships among these variables and assess how well they align with expected performance benchmarks.


## Acknowledgments üôè

This analysis is based on movie industry data and was inspired by the need for data-driven insights in strategic decision-making. Special thanks to the contributors and the open-source community for their support.


## üìÑ Project Description
This project focuses on a financial and strategic analysis of movie companies, examining key variables such as **total revenue**, **number of releases**, and **lifetime gross** over time. We employ descriptive and inferential statistical techniques to uncover valuable insights that can support strategic decision-making in the film industry.

## üîç Analysis Objectives

print("Variance - Releases:", variance_releases)
print("Variance - Lifetime Gross:", variance_lifetime_gross)
```

### 4. Mode and Median Calculations

```python
# Calculate modes (values that occur most frequently in each column)
# Useful for identifying common values in main variables
modes = pd.concat([df['Total'].mode(), df['Releases'].mode(), df['Lifetime Gross'].mode()], axis=1)
modes.columns = ['Mode_Total', 'Mode_Releases', 'Mode_Lifetime_Gross']
print("Variable Modes:\n", modes)
```
#### 4a. Calculate medians for central tendency in distributions

```python
median_total = int(df['Total'].median())

median_lifetime_gross = int(df['Lifetime Gross'].median())
print("Median - Total:", median_total)
print("Median - Releases:", median_releases)
print("Median - Lifetime Gross:", median_lifetime_gross)
```

### 5. Applying T-Tests to check if the mean of the variables differs from a reference value.

```python
# Apply t-tests to check if the variable means differ from a specific reference value
# Using reference values as per provided data

# T-test for 'Total' with a reference value of 2 billion
t_test_total = stats.ttest_1samp(df['Total'], 2.000000e+09)
print("T-Test for Total:", t_test_total)
```

#### 5a. Definition of the significance level:

```python
alpha = 0.05
```

#### 5b. Null hypothesis check for 'Total':

```python
if t_test_total.pvalue < alpha:
    print("We reject the null hypothesis (H0) for Total.")
else:
    print("We accept the null hypothesis (H0) for Total.")
```


### 6. Calculation of the t-test for 'Releases':

```python
# Teste t para a vari√°vel 'Releases' com valor de refer√™ncia 22
t_test_releases = stats.ttest_1samp(df['Releases'], 22)
print("Teste t para Releases:", t_test_releases)
```

#### 6a. Definition of the significance level:

```python
alpha = 0.05
```

#### 6b. Null hypothesis check for 'Releases':

```python
if t_test_total.pvalue < alpha:
    print("We reject the null hypothesis (H0) for Total.")

# T-test for 'Lifetime Gross' with a reference value of 250 million
stats.ttest_1samp(df['Lifetime Gross'], 2.500000e+08)
print("Teste t para Lifetime Gross:", t_test_lifetime_gross)
```

#### 7a. Definition of the significance level:

```python
alpha = 0.05
```

#### 7b. Null hypothesis check for 'Lifetime Gross':

```python
if t_test_total.pvalue < alpha:
    print("We reject the null hypothesis (H0) for Total.")
else:
    print("We accept the null hypothesis (H0) for Total.")
```


### 8. Correlation Heatmap Code üî•

```python
# Correlation Heatmap Visualization
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Creating the correlation heatmap to visualize relationships between numeric variables
# The heatmap helps identify strong or weak relationships between variables
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))

## <p align="center"> üé¨ Main Conclusions of the Study and Strategic Recommendations

1. **üìà Consistent Performance in the Industry**
   
   The statistical analysis indicates that, overall, the observed averages for total revenue, number of releases, and cumulative revenue align with industry benchmarks. This alignment suggests that studios are performing within expected standards for the film industry, reflecting that their strategies are effectively yielding revenue that meets market standards.

   <br>

2. **üîó Positive Relationships Between Releases, Cumulative Revenue, and Total Revenue**  

   A key finding in the correlation analysis is the positive relationship between the number of releases, a film‚Äôs cumulative revenue, and a studio‚Äôs total revenue. The correlation suggests that studios with more releases or those producing films with high cumulative earnings tend to generate higher overall revenue. This means that, strategically, there‚Äôs value in prioritizing both the quantity of releases and the revenue potential of each film. The direct relationship between these variables underscores that both aspects‚Äîvolume and the box office potential of films‚Äîare crucial for a studio‚Äôs overall financial success.
   
  <br>

3. **üé≠ Significant Variability Among Studios**  

   The descriptive statistics reveal significant diversity in total revenue, number of releases, and cumulative revenue across studios. This variability reflects the flexible strategies adopted by different studios and shows how they tailor their practices according to resources, market positioning, and audience characteristics. This highlights that there is no single approach that works for all; instead, different strategies may be effective depending on each company‚Äôs unique attributes and goals.

  <br><br>

## <p align="center"> üöÄ Strategic Conclusions and Recommendations 

Based on the findings, here are some recommendations to help studios optimize their financial results and stay competitive:

1. **üéØ Focus on High-Earning Films**  

    The observed correlation between a film‚Äôs cumulative revenue and a studio‚Äôs total revenue suggests that high-grossing films significantly contribute to overall revenue. Therefore, it would be advantageous to prioritize investments in titles with high potential for success, whether through established franchises, renowned talent, or intensive marketing. These ‚Äúhigh-yield‚Äù films can often have a disproportionately positive impact on total revenue.

   <br>

2. **‚öñÔ∏è Optimize Release Volume**  

   In addition to focusing on high-potential titles, studios should consider a balanced annual release volume. The study found that a moderate release volume correlates with strong cumulative revenue, indicating that studios that avoid oversaturating the market can maximize the return from each release without straining production and marketing resources. Planning releases in strategic timeframes and avoiding excessive overlap can also enhance the financial performance of each film.

<br>

3. **üìä Targeted Marketing and High-Revenue Genres**  

    Finally, implementing specific marketing strategies can help boost the performance of certain genres, especially those that tend to generate higher revenues. Targeted marketing based on genre, audience, and previous success can amplify a film‚Äôs earning potential. This approach allows studios to allocate marketing resources more efficiently, ensuring that each release reaches the right audience and maximizes its success.

  <br><br>

**üìã Final Conclusion**

In summary, the results suggest that studios are in a solid competitive position, employing strategies aligned with market expectations and optimizing their revenue growth potential. By balancing the volume of releases with each film‚Äôs quality and potential success, studios can continue to enhance their financial performance. Additionally, targeted marketing strategies can help capture more value from the audience, strengthening the impact of each release. In essence, a combination of high-yield films, a moderate release volume, and targeted marketing may be an effective formula for studios aiming to maximize their total revenue and solidify their position in the film industry.
